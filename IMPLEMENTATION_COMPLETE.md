# ✅ Implementation Complete: Fixed extract_words_with_context()

## Summary

Successfully fixed critical bug in `backend/src/helpers.rs::extract_words_with_context()` that caused word extraction to fail when processing Pāli texts with repeated words and Unicode diacritics.

## Problem

After extracting words with diacritics (e.g., "jānāmi"), the function would skip subsequent words, leaving them with empty `original_word` and `context_snippet` fields. This broke:
- GlossTab.qml vocabulary generation
- Anki CSV export
- Word lookup functionality

**Root cause:** Mixing byte positions with character positions in Unicode text.

## Solution

Implemented a staged, character-based algorithm with sandhi-aware fuzzy matching:

1. **Text Preprocessing** - Handle Pāli sandhi transformations
2. **Word Extraction** - Split into clean tokens
3. **Position Finding** - Character-based sequential search with sandhi awareness
4. **Context Boundaries** - Calculate sentence-aware regions
5. **Snippet Building** - Generate HTML with bold tags

### Key Innovation: Sandhi-Aware Matching

The algorithm intelligently handles Pāli sandhi transformations:
- Preprocessed: `passāmi` (after ī'ti → i ti transformation)
- Original: `passāmī` (long vowel in source text)
- Matcher: Recognizes `ā↔a`, `ī↔i`, `ū↔u` as equivalent

## Test Results

```
✅ All 147 backend tests pass (0 failures)
✅ Fixed test: test_repeated_words_no_skipping
   - Before: 26/40 words missing
   - After: 40/40 words extracted correctly
✅ New test suite: 8 staged tests covering each algorithm stage
✅ All 18 word extraction tests pass
```

## Files Changed

### Implementation
- `backend/src/helpers.rs` - Complete rewrite with staged architecture

### New Tests
- `backend/tests/test_staged_word_extraction.rs` - 8 new tests
- `backend/tests/test_debug_position_tracking.rs` - 3 debug tests  
- `backend/tests/test_sandhi_debug.rs` - Enhanced debug output

### Documentation
- `tasks/implementation-summary-extract-words-fix.md` - Detailed summary
- `tasks/archive/prd-fix-extract-words-with-context-repeated-words.md` - Original PRD

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run the specific fixed test
cd backend && cargo test test_repeated_words_no_skipping

# Run all word extraction tests  
cd backend && cargo test --test test_extract_words_with_context

# Run all backend tests
cd backend && cargo test
```

## Impact

- ✅ All words now extracted from Pāli texts
- ✅ GlossTab.qml shows complete vocabulary
- ✅ Anki CSV export includes all words
- ✅ Repeated words handled correctly
- ✅ Unicode diacritics processed correctly
- ✅ Pāli sandhi transformations supported

## Example Result

**Input:** `"iti jānāmi, iti passāmī"ti, tato aparena...`

**Output:** All 40 words correctly extracted with:
- Non-empty `original_word` for each
- Proper `context_snippet` with `<b>` tags
- Second "iti" at different position from first
- Both "jānāmi" occurrences found
- Sandhi-derived words (like `passāmī→passāmi`) matched correctly
