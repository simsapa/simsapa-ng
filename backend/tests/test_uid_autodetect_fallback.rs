// Integration test for the self-correcting UID auto-detect (P4).
//
// The localhost API routes (dict_combined_search / search / run_suttas_search)
// route a uid-like query to UidMatch, then re-run the original query under a
// fallback mode when that auto UidMatch returns 0 hits
// (run_search_with_uid_fallback in bridges/src/api.rs). The bridges crate can't
// be unit-tested (cxx-qt linking), so this backend test pins the *premise* the
// fallback relies on against the live DB: for "dhamma 1.01" the auto UidMatch
// misses while DpdLookup hits. See docs/simsapa-localhost-api-search-endpoints.md.

/// Validates the fallback chain that run_dict_combined_with_fallback relies on
/// for the numbered display form "dhamma 1.01":
///  - it auto-detects as uid-like, but the raw UidMatch (and a raw DpdLookup)
///    both return 0 hits (the number breaks both);
///  - the normalized UidMatch (Task 1.3: -> uid:dhamma-1-01/dpd) returns the
///    exact headword. This is why the dictionary fallback normalizes before
///    re-running, rather than just re-running DpdLookup on the original.
