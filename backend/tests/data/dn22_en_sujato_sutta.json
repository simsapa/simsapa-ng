consciousness tongue consciousness body consciousness mind consciousness in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles eye contact ear contact nose contact tongue contact body contact mind contact in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles feeling born of eye contact feeling born of ear contact feeling born of nose contact feeling born of tongue contact feeling born of body contact feeling born of mind contact in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles perception of sights perception of sounds perception of smells perception of tastes perception of touches perception of ideas in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles intention regarding sights intention regarding sounds intention regarding smells intention regarding tastes intention regarding touches intention regarding ideas in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles craving for sights craving for sounds craving for smells craving for tastes craving for touches craving for ideas in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles thoughts about sights thoughts about sounds thoughts about smells thoughts about tastes thoughts about touches thoughts about ideas in the world seem nice and pleasant and it is there that craving arises and settles considerations regarding sights considerations regarding sounds considerations regarding smells considerations regarding tastes

suffering 4 5 3 the cessation of suffering and what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering it s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over giving it away letting it go releasing it and not clinging to it whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant it is there that craving is given up and ceases and what in the world seems nice and pleasant the eye in the world seems nice and pleasant and it is there that craving is given up and ceases considerations regarding ideas in the world seem nice and pleasant and it is there that craving is given up and ceases this is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering 4 5 4 the path and what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering it is simply this noble eightfold path that is: right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion and what is right view knowing about suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering this is called right view and what is right thought thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness this is called right thought and what is right speech the refraining from lying divisive speech harsh speech and talking nonsense this is called right speech and what is right action

enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness this is called right immersion this is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering and so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally externally and both internally and externally they meditate observing the principles as liable to originate as liable to fall and as liable to both originate and vanish or mindfulness is established that principles exist to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness they meditate independent not grasping at anything in the world that s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven years can expect one of two results: enlightenment in this very life or if there s something left over non return let alone seven years anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for six years five years four years three years two years one year seven months six months five months four months three months two months one month a fortnight let alone a fortnight anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven days can expect one of two results: enlightenment in this very life or if there s something left over non return the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence they are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to discover the system and to realize extinguishment that s what i said and this is why i said it that is what the buddha said satisfied the mendicants approved what the buddha said",
