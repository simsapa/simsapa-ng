In accordance with common usage, “understanding” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṭivijānantassa</i>) must refer to understanding the overall meaning of what is said, not to knowing the exact words that have been spoken. Since the speaker knows he is lying, he understands the overall meaning. It follows that the understanding here must refer to the listener.
