It examines the ways that the process of perception and identification evolves with progress on the path. It was translated, together with its commentary and extensive analysis, by Bhikkhu Bodhi as <em>The Discourse on the Root of Existence</em>. The commentarial background is also found in the Mūlapariyāya Jātaka (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja245/en/sujato'>Ja 245</a>). The commentary connects this sutta with the Gotamakacetiyasutta (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.125/en/sujato'>AN 3.125</a>), but there is no internal evidence to support this.)</span></span></span>

The similar sequence at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato#23.1'>MN 49:23.1</a> culminates with “all”. Three interpretations: (1) <em>Simple textual error</em>. Of the three Chinese parallels, EA 44.6 mentions <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbāna</i> here, while MA 106 and T 56 do not. If two separate texts have the same error, it predates the separation between the schools, or arose later through contamination. (2) <em>The five kinds of “extinguishment in the present life”</em>. These are false liberations believed by sectarians (Brahmajālasutta, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#3.19.1'>DN 1:3.19.1</a>). The commentary says they are meant here, but it seems unlikely, given that below the stream-enterer is enjoined to not identify with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbāna</i>, whereas they have already dispelled such misconceptions of the path. (3) <em>An unenlightened person’s misconception of the Buddhist goal</em>. At least some ancient Buddhists read it this way, as this passage is quoted in an Abhidhamma discussion as to whether the deathless as an object of thought can be a fetter (Kathāvatthu 9.2). The Theravāda commentary, rejecting this, says it was the view of the Pubbaseliyas, a branch of the Mahāsaṅghikas.)</span></span></span>

                <span class='translated'>But the mendicants did not approve what the Buddha said. <span class='comment-wrap'><span class='mark'>✱</span><span class='comment hide'>(That they “did not approve” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>na abhinanduṁ</i>) is confirmed in the commentary and in the parallel at EA 44.6, which explains that the mendicants did not understand the discourse. Alternatively, some modern interpreters (Bodhi, Ñāṇananda), relying on the commentarial background explanation, suggest that the problem was that they understood it all too well and were not happy that their beliefs were challenged. These explanations, however, do not take into account the centrality of “approval” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nanda</i>)—it is literally the “root” that lends the discourse its title. Given that an arahant does not “approve” even Nibbāna, and that “approval” is the root of suffering, is it any wonder that the audience did not “approve” the teaching? It is not that they did not understand, nor that their understanding threatened their egos, but that they understood so well that they received the teaching with perfect equanimity. Elsewhere the Buddha urged that one should “neither approve (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhinandati</i>) nor dismiss” a teaching (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#2.5'>AN 4.180:2.5</a> = <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.8.4'>DN 16:4.8.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#18.4'>DN 29:18.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn112/en/sujato#3.1'>MN 112:3.1</a>). It seems that the normal response, where the audience approves a teaching with pleasure, is meant in a conventional sense, whereas this sutta shows how for an arahant all such responses are transcended.)</span></span></span>
