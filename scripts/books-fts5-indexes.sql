-- Create the FTS5 virtual table with trigram tokenizer
-- The trigram tokenizer enables efficient substring matching like LIKE '%query%'
-- detail='none' reduces index size by not storing term positions
--
-- PERFORMANCE: the source row id (book_spine_items.id) is stored as the FTS5
-- `rowid`, NOT as a separate UNINDEXED column. FTS5 has no secondary indexes,
-- so a `WHERE spine_item_id = ?` lookup against an UNINDEXED column is a FULL
-- TABLE SCAN; the per-row delete/update triggers would then scan the whole FTS
-- table once per affected row. Using the rowid makes those lookups O(log n).
-- Queries join `f.rowid = book_spine_items.id` instead of the old
-- `f.spine_item_id`.
