-- Migration: FTS5 fulltext search for dpd_headwords.lemma_1 for efficient "%{}%" LIKE queries
-- This enables fast substring matching for DPD headword searches

-- Drop existing FTS table and triggers if they exist
-- This ensures we start fresh with the new schema

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS dpd_headwords_fts_update;

-- Create the FTS5 virtual table with trigram tokenizer
-- The trigram tokenizer enables efficient substring matching like LIKE '%query%'
-- detail='none' reduces index size by not storing term positions
--
-- PERFORMANCE: the source row id (dpd_headwords.id) is stored as the FTS5
-- `rowid`, NOT as a separate UNINDEXED column. FTS5 has no secondary indexes,
-- so a `WHERE headword_id = ?` lookup against an UNINDEXED column is a FULL
-- TABLE SCAN; the per-row delete/update triggers would then scan the whole FTS
-- table once per affected row. Using the rowid makes those lookups O(log n).
-- Queries select `rowid AS headword_id` instead of the old `headword_id` column.

-- Populate the FTS table with existing data
-- Only insert rows where lemma_1 is not NULL (though it should always have a value).
-- `rowid` is set to dpd_headwords.id so deletes/updates can use the fast rowid path.
