<p>I regard you as an attainer-of-knowledge,</p>

<p id="stnp_note5.4.01">1. On the meaning of “acquisition,” see <a href="ssp://suttas/snp3.12#snp.note3.12.02/en/thanissaro#stnp_note3.12.02">Sn 3:12, note 2</a>. </p>
<p id="stnp_note5.4.02">2. This verse is identical with the second set of verses in <a href="ssp://suttas/snp3.12/en/thanissaro">Sn 3:12</a>.</p>
<p id="stnp_note5.4.03">3. Nd II gives six different valid interpretations for ‘above, below, across, in between’:</p>
<p>a) above = the future; below = the past; across and in between = the present,</p>
<p>b) above = the deva world; below = hell; across and in between = the human world,</p>
<p>c) above = skillfulness; below = unskillfulness; across and in between = indeterminate mental qualities,</p>
<p>d) above = the property of formlessness; below = the property of sensuality; across and in between = the property of form,</p>
<p>e) above = feelings of pleasure; below = feelings of pain; across and in between = feelings of neither pleasure nor pain,</p>
<p>f) above = the body from the feet on up; below = the body from the crown of the head on down; across and in between = the middle of the body.</p>
<p id="stnp_note5.4.04">4. On unestablished consciousness, see <a href="ssp://suttas/sn12.38/en/thanissaro">SN 12:38</a>, <a href="ssp://suttas/sn12.63/en/thanissaro">SN 12:63–64</a>, <a href="ssp://suttas/sn22.53/en/thanissaro">SN 22:53–54</a>, and 22:87. See also the discussion of this topic in <em>The Paradox of Becoming,</em> chapter 7.</p>
<p id="stnp_note5.4.05">5. Becoming and non-becoming (or dis-becoming) are the two most subtle objects of craving that lead on to continued existence—and suffering—in the round of birth and death. See <a href="ssp://suttas/ud3.10/en/thanissaro">Ud 3:10</a>, <a href="ssp://suttas/iti49/en/thanissaro">Iti 49</a>, and <a href="ssp://suttas/mn49/en/thanissaro">MN 49</a>, note 10.
