<h1>Before the Breakup</h1>
<p>1. <em>How seeing and how conducting oneself</em><br />
<em>is one said to be ‘at peace’?</em><br />
<em>This do tell me, O Gotama,</em><br />
<em>being asked about the supreme man.</em></p>
<p>2. With craving gone before the break-up,<br />
not leaning back on the past,<br />
not reckonable in the middle<br />
there is nothing put in front<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">1</a></sup> of him.</p>
<p>3. Free of anger, not given to fear,<br />
not boastful, free of wrong-doings,<br />
talking considerately, not agitated,<br />
he is a Muni regarding speech.</p>
<p>4. He has no longing for the future,<br />
he does not sorrow over the past.<br />
Seeing how to stay aloof in present contacts<br />
he is not led in among the views.</p>
<p>5. Keeping withdrawn, not deceitful,<br />
not envious, not avaricious,<br />
unobtrusive, not repulsive,<br />
he does not engage in slander.</p>
<p>6. Not attracted to pleasant things,<br />
not given to arrogance,<br />
he is gentle and resourceful,<br />
not going by faith and not trying to get detached.</p>
<p>7. Out of desire for gains he does not train himself<br />
and does not get upset at not gaining.<br />
He does not get opposed due to craving,<br />
and is not greedy for tastes.</p>
<p>8. Equanimous and ever mindful,<br />
he does not think of anyone as his equal,<br />
nor of himself as superior or inferior —<br />
he has no prominences.</p>
<p>9. He for whom there is nothing to depend upon,<br />
having known the nature of things independently,<br />
and for whom neither for being nor for unbeing<br />
there is found any craving —</p>
<p>10. him I call the peaceful one,<br />
the one without concern for sensual pleasures.<br />
For him there are no knots,<br />
for he has crossed the viscosity.</p>
<p>11. For him neither sons nor cattle<br />
nor fields and land are to be found.<br />
The assumed and the rejected<br />
also these are not to be found in him.</p>
<p>12. That by which they might tell him, the common people<br />
or else the recluses and brahmins,<br />
that is not paid attention<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#8">2</a></sup> to by him.<br />
Therefore he is not shaken by what they say.</p>
<p>13. Being free of greed and avarice<br />
the Muni does not speak of himself<br />
in terms of superiority, equality or inferiority,<br />
he does not enter into what can be classed, he is not classifiable.</p>
<p>14. He for whom nothing in the world is his own<br />
and who does not grieve at the absence<br />
and does not go around in ideas —<br />
he is truly said to be “at peace”.</p>
